## 🙋🏻‍♂️ I’m Léo! A web developer based in Caen 🍎 ## 

Currently working on my portfolio and other projects that bring me joy. Certainly not a todo app or a trello bis... Or maybe should I? 🤷🏻‍♂️

🌱 I’m also currently learning on myself. That was not expected but it is was it is.

## 🏀 Stuff to get to know me better  ## 

The main things I love are: playing basketball, video games, science, culture, and languages. 

In the past few years, I have discovered programming, and I have decided that it is going to be my next ambition. So I quit my job, I found a way to learn code, and then I joined O'Clock School. I have never stopped since. Except for the adventure of my life, so far... I have done a 4-month cycling trip around Scandinavia in Summer 2023. Best decision ever. 

Since I came back, I have kept learning and practicing my coding skills, discovering the wonderful dev process, and starting to enjoy code reviews and PRs !
