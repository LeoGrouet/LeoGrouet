### Hello there 👋

👨🏻‍💻 Currently working on my portfolio and other projects that bring me joy. Certainly not a todo app or a trello bis... Or maybe I should. 🤷🏻‍♂️
  
🌱 I’m currently learning on myself. That was not expected but it is was it is.


Some about me :

`I love basketball, video games, science, culture, langage... I love a very different kinds of stuff .
Since few years, I discovered programation and I decide that this going to be my next ambition. So I quit my job, I found the way to learn code, and then I join O'Clock School.
I never stopped since. Except for the aventure of my life .... so far... I have done a 4 months cycling trip around Scandinavie in summer 2023. Best decision ever.
Since I came back, I kept learning and practicing my coding skills`
